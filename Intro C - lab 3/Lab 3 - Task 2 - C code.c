/*
 * 3.2 Task 2  Computation of e^x
 * This task requires knowledge on absolute value and factorial.
 * You can read about factorial at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial (Links to an external site.)
 * The exponential function ex can be represented by the Taylor series:
 *
 * where n! denotes the factorial of n. This Taylor series is an infinite series and it is not
 * possible for you to implement an infinite loop to compute the function. In practice,
 * it is enough to add the first n terms as a good approximation. The more terms are summed,
 * the result is more accurate.
 *
 * The requirements on the solution are

 * You can only use basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in your solution.
 * No math function like pow( ) should be used in the computation.
 * The value of ex is obtained by summing up terms in the Taylor series until it finds that
 * the absolute value of a term is less than 0.0000001.
 * Your solution should print out a table of values summing up 1, 2, 3, â€¦n terms
